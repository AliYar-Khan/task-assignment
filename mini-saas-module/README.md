## Overview

The Mini SaaS Module is designed to manage multiple tenants within a single application instance. It provides a robust framework for tenant management, module handling, and security practices, ensuring that each tenant's data is isolated and secure.

## Architecture

The project is structured as follows:

- **src/app.ts**: Entry point of the application, initializes the server and sets up middleware.
- **src/middleware/security.ts**: Implements security middleware functions.
- **src/utils/index.ts**: Provides utility functions for common tasks.
- **src/types/index.ts**: Defines TypeScript interfaces for type safety.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd mini-saas-module
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Compile TypeScript files:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

4. Start the application:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with the API to manage tenants and modules. Refer to the API documentation for detailed usage instructions.

## Testing

To run the tests, use the following command:
```
npm test
```
This will execute the unit tests defined in the `tests` directory.

## Best Practices

- Ensure that all API requests are authenticated and authorized.
- Follow secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities.
- Regularly update dependencies to mitigate security risks.
- Maintain clear and concise documentation for ease of use and onboarding.
